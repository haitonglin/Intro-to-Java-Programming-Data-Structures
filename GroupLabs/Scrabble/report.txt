what (if any) bugs you found in your own Board implementation:

Our own board implementation was generally okay but there are two small things
that we found: in the other boards the positions without letters are empty, but
our board put a char value in it, causing potential problems for checking 
getLetterAt() problem. Additionally, we realized that we can simplify some parts
of the PlayWord() method so the program will have a better performance.
We have updated our board implementations, fix the small problems mentioned above
and also made them more compact.


what bug was present in the app.BrokenBoard class you got from the TAs:

The coordinates in the broken board we got is swapped by mistake. As a result,
the words that are supposed to be horizontal ended up being vertical and the words
that are vertical ended up being horizontal. The mistake was a very obviouly one and 
we can get it by looking at the output but also through the getLetterAt() method.
